# 👋 Hi, I'm Christopher Faris, a programmer and student at Valencia College

### A little bit about me:

I moved here from Detroit, Michigan a little over 3 years ago and have enjoyed my time here in Florida so far.
I am in my final year of my BAS for Computing Technology and Software Development at Valencia College.
I have recently learned Python as my second language after Java and it quickly has become my favorite. 
I look to learn web development next and create some personal projects. Always looking to learn new features and skillsets.

### My hobbies-

- 📺Watching basketball, football and baseball.
- 🏓Playing pickleball.
- 🎮Playing videogames like Borderlands and Rocket League.
- 🍔Trying new restaurants.
