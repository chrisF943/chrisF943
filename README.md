# 👋Christopher Faris - Programmer and Student at Valencia College

## 📚My favorite class at the moment is Seminar in Advanced Software Development

### A little bit about me:

I moved here from Detroit, Michigan a little over 3 years ago and have enjoyed my time here in Florida so far.
I am in my final year of my BAS for Computing Technology and Software Development at Valencia College.
I have recently learned Python as my second language after Java and it quickly has become my favorite. Mac is
my workstation of choice because of the integration with my other Apple products.

### My Hobbies-

- Watching basketball, football and baseball.
- Playing pickleball.
- Playing videogames like Borderlands and Rocket League.
- Trying new restaurants.
