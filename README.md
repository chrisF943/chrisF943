### A little bit about me:

I moved to Orlando from Detroit, Michigan a little over 3 years ago and have enjoyed my time here in Florida so far.
I am in the final year of my BAS for Computing Technology and Software Development at Valencia College.
I have a love for Python and my current focus is to sharpen my skills in data science/engineering. This summer, I am extremely eager to intern at Hillpointe as a data engineer. I am always looking to strengthen my skills and contribute with others to make an impact.

### My hobbies-

- 📺Watching basketball, football and baseball.
- 🏓Playing pickleball.
- 🎮Playing videogames like The Division 2, Dead By Daylight, and Borderlands.
- 🍔Trying new restaurants.
